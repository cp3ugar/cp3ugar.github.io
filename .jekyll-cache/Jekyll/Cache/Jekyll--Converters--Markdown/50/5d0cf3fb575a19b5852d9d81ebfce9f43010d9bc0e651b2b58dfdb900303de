<h1 id="connectingsendingand-receiving">Connecting,Sending,and Receiving</h1>

<p>The three things we have to learn to get the client working are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>How to establish the initial <strong>connection</strong> between the client and server</li>
  <li>How to <strong>send</strong> messages to the server</li>
  <li>How to <strong>receive</strong> messages from the server</li>
</ol>

<p>Thereâ€™s a lot of low-level stuff that has to happen fort these things to work. But weâ€™re lucky,because the Java API networking package makes it a piece of cake for programmers. Youâ€™ll see a lot more GUI code than networking and I/O code.</p>

<h1 id="the-deadly-side-of-synchronization">The deadly side of synchronization</h1>

<p>Thread deadlock happens when you have two threads,both of which are holding a key the other thread wants. Thereâ€™s no way out of this scenario,so the two threads will simply sit and wait. And wait. And wait.</p>
