<h3 id="borderlayout">BorderLayout</h3>

<p>A BorderLayout manager divides a background component into five regions. You can add only one component into five regions. You can add only one component per region to a background controlled by a BorderLayout manager. Components laid out by this manager usually donâ€™t get to have their preferred size. <strong>BorderLayout is the default layout manager for a frame!</strong></p>

<h3 id="flowlayout">FlowLayout</h3>

<p>A FlowLayout manager acts kinds of like a word processor,except with components instead of words. Each component is the size it wants to be,and theyâ€™re laid out left to right in the order that theyâ€™re added,with â€œword-wrapâ€ turned on. So when a component won;t fit horizontally,it drops to the next â€œlineâ€ in the layout. <strong>FlowLayout is the default layout manager for a panel!</strong></p>

<h3 id="boxlayout">BoxLayout</h3>

<p>A BoxLayout manager is like FlowLayout in that each component gets to have its own size,and the components are placed in the order in which theyâ€™re added. But,unlike FlowLayout,a BoxLayout manager can stack the components vertically. Itâ€™s like a FlowLayout but instead of having automatic â€˜component wrappingâ€™,you can insert a sort of â€˜component return keyâ€™ and <strong><u>force</u></strong> the components to start a new line.</p>
