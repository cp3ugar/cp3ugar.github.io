I"­Y<h1 id="declaring-a-variable">Declaring a variable</h1>

<p><strong>Java cares about type.</strong> It wonâ€™t let you do something bizarre and dangerous like stuff a Giraffe reference into a Rabbit variableâ€”â€”what happens when someone tries to ask the so-called Rabbit to hop()?And it wonâ€™t let you put a floating point number into an integer variable,unless you <em>acknowledge to the compiler</em> that you know you might lose precision.</p>

<p>The compiler can spot most problems:</p>

<p><strong>Rabbit hopper = new Giraffe();</strong></p>

<p>Donâ€™t expect that to compile.</p>

<p>For all this type-safety to work,you must declare the type of your variable. Is it an integer?a Dog?A single character?Variables come in two flavors: <em>primitive</em> and <em>object reference</em>. Primitives hold fundamental values including integers,booleans,and floating point numbers. Object references hold,well,<em>references</em> to <em>objects</em>.</p>

<p>Weâ€™ll look at primitives first and then move on to what an object reference really means. But regardless of the type,you must follow two declaration rules:</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="variables-must-have-a-type"><center>variables must have a **type**</center></h3>

<hr />

<p>Besides a type,variable needs a name,so that you can use that name in code.</p>

<h1 id="id-like-a-double-mochanomake-it-an-int">â€œIâ€™d like a double mocha,no,make it an int.â€</h1>

<p>When you think of Java variables,think of cups. Coffee cups,tea cups,giant cups that hold lots and lots of beer,those big cups the popcorn comes in at the movies,cups with curvy,sexy handles,and cups with metallic trim that you learned can never,ever go in the microwave.</p>

<p><strong>A variable is just a cup. A container. It holds something.</strong></p>

<p>It has a size,and a type. In this chapter,weâ€™re going to look first at the variables that hold <strong>primitives</strong>,then a little later weâ€™ll look at cups that hold <em>references to objects</em>. Stay with us here on the whole cup analogyâ€”as simple as it is right now,itâ€™ll give us a common way to look at things when the discussion gets more complex. And thatâ€™ll happen soon.</p>

<p>Primitives are like the cups they have at the coffeehouse. If youâ€™re been to a Starbucks,you know what weâ€™re talking about here. They come in different sizes,and each has a name like â€˜shortâ€™,â€™tallâ€™.,and,â€Iâ€™d like a â€˜grandeâ€™ mocha half-caff with extra whipped creamâ€.</p>

<p>You might see the cups displayed on the counter,so you can order appropriately:</p>

<p><img src="../../assets/img/image-20201120142749174.png" alt="image-20201120142749174" /></p>

<p>And in Java,primitives come in different sizes,and those sizes have names. When you declare a variable in Java,you must declare it with a specific type. The four containers here are for the four integer primitives in Java.</p>

<p><img src="../../assets/img/image-20201120143001680.png" alt="image-20201120143001680" /></p>

<p>Each cup holds a value,so for Java primitives,rather than saying,â€Iâ€™d like a tall french roastâ€,you say to the compiler,â€Iâ€™d like an int variable with the number 90 please.â€ Except for one tiny differenceâ€¦in Java you also have to give your cup a name. So itâ€™s actually,â€Iâ€™d like an int please,with the value of 2486,and name the variable <em>height</em>.â€ Each primitive variable has a fixed number of bits. The sizes of the six numeric primitives in Java are shown below:</p>

<p>Gotta have â€œfâ€ with a float,because Java thinks anything with a floating point is a double,unless you use â€œfâ€.</p>

<h1 id="you-really-dont-want-to-spill-that">You really donâ€™t want to spill thatâ€¦</h1>

<p><strong>Be sure the value can fit into the variable.</strong></p>

<p>You canâ€™t put a large value into a small cup.</p>

<p>The compiler tries to help prevent <em>spillage</em> if it can tell from your code that somethingâ€™s not going to fit in the container youâ€™re using.</p>

<p>Why doesnâ€™t this work? After all,the value of x is 24,and 24 is definitely small enough to fit into a byte. You know that,and we know that,but all compiler cares about is that youâ€™re trying to put a big thing into a small thing,and thereâ€™s the possibility of spilling. Donâ€™t expect the compiler to know what the value of x is,even if you happen to be able to see it literally in your code.</p>

<p><strong>You can assign a value to a variable in one of several ways including:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>type a literal value after the equals sign</li>
  <li>assign the value of one variable to another</li>
  <li>use an expression combining the two</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="back-away-from-that-keyword">Back away from that keyword!</h1>

<p>You know you need a name and a type for your variables.</p>

<p><strong>But what can you use as names?</strong>The rules are simple. You can name a class,method,or variable according to the following rules:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>It must start with a letter,underscore,or dollar sign. You canâ€™t start a name with a number.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>After the first character,you can use numbers as well. Just donâ€™t start it with a number.</strong></li>
  <li>**It can be anything you like,subject to those two rules,just so long as it isnâ€™t one of Javaâ€™s reserved words,are keywords that the compiler recognizes. **</li>
</ul>

<p>And if you really want to play confuse-compiler,then just try using a reserved word as a name.</p>

<p>You know how to declare a primitive variable and assign it a value. But now what about non-primitive variables?In other words,what about objects?</p>

And the JVM knows how to use the reference to get to the object.</h4>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>You canâ€™t stuff an object into a variable. We often think of it that wayâ€¦we say things like,â€I passed the String to the System.out.println() method.â€ Or,â€The method returns a Dogâ€,or,â€I put a new Foo object into variable named myFoo.â€</p>

<p>But thatâ€™s not what happens. There arenâ€™t giant expandable cups that can grow to the size of any object. Objects live in one place and one place onlyâ€”the garbage collectible heap!</p>

<p>Although a primitive variable is full of bits representing the actual <strong>value</strong> of the variable,an object reference variable is full of bits representing <strong>a way to get to the object</strong>.</p>

<p>You use the dot operator on a reference variable to say,â€user the thing before the dot to get me the thing after the dot.â€For example:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">myDog.bark();</code></p>

<p>means,â€use the object referenced by the variable myDog to invoke the bark() method.â€ When you use the dot operator on an object reference variable,think of it like pressing a button on the remote control for that object.</p>

<p><strong>A</strong>:You donâ€™t know. Unless youâ€™re cozy with someone on the JVMâ€™s development team,you donâ€™t know how a reference is represented. There are pointers in there somewhere,but you canâ€™t access them. You wonâ€™t need to. But when youâ€™re talking about memory allocation issues,your Big Concern should be about how many objects youâ€™re creating,and how big they really are.</p>
