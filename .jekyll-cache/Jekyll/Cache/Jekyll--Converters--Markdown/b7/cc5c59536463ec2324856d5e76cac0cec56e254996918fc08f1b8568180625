<h3 id="connection-streams-represent-a-connection-to-a-source-or-destination-while-chain-streams-cant-connect-on-their-own-and-must-be-chained-to-a-connection-stream"><strong><u>Connection</u> streams represent a connection to a source or destination while <u>chain</u> streams can‚Äôt connect on their own and must be chained to a connection stream.</strong></h3>

<p>The Java I/O API has <strong><em>connection</em></strong> streams,that represent connections to destinations and sources such as files or network sockects,and <strong><em>chain</em></strong> streams that work only if chained to other streams.</p>

<p>Often,it takes at least two streams hooked together to do something useful‚Äîone to represent the connection and <em>anohter</em> to call methods on. Why two? Because <em>connection</em> streams are usually too low-level. FileOutputStream,for example,has methods for writing <em>bytes</em>. But we don‚Äôt want to write <em>bytes</em>! We want to write <em>objects</em>,so we need a higher-level <em>chain</em> stream.</p>

<p>Then why not have just a songle stream that does <em>exactly</em> what you want? Once that lets you write objects but underneath converts them to bytes? Think good OO. Each class does <em>one</em> thing well.</p>

<p>Easy enough to save the <em>primitive</em> values 37 and 70. But what if an object has an instance variable that‚Äôs an object <em>reference</em>? What about an object that has five instance variables that are object references? What if those object instance variables themselves have instance variables?</p>

<p>This Kennel object has a reference to a Dog[] array object. The Dog[] holds references to two Dog objects. Each Dog object holds a reference to a String and a Collar object. The String objects have a collection of characters and the Collar objects have an int.</p>

<h1 id="if-you-want-your-class-to-be-serializableimplement-serializable">If you want your class to be serializable,implement <u>Serializable</u></h1>

<p>The Serializable interface is known as a <em>marker</em> or tag interface,because the interface doesn‚Äôt have any methods to implement. Its sole purpose is to announce that the class implementing it is,well,<em>serializable</em>. In other words,objects of that type are savable through the serialization mechanism. If any superclass of a class is serializable,the subclass is automatically serializable even if the subclass doesn‚Äôt explicitly declare implements <em>Serializable</em>.</p>

Why doesn‚Äôt class Object implement Serializable,and then all subclasses will be automatically Serializable.</strong></h3>

<p><strong>A:</strong>Even though most classes will,and should,implement Serializable,you always have a choice. And you must make a conscious decision on a class-by-class basis,for each class you design,to ‚Äòenable‚Äô serialization by implementing Serialiable. First of all,if serialization were the default,how would you turn if off? Interfaces indicate functionality,not a lack of functionality,so the model of polymorphism wouldn‚Äôt work correctly if you had ro say,‚Äôimplements NonSerializable‚Äô to tell the world that you cannot be saved.</p>

<h1 id="deserialization-restoring-an-object">Deserialization: restoring an object</h1>

<p>The whole point of serializing an object is so that you can restore it back to its original state at some later date,in a different ‚Äòrun‚Äô of the JVM.</p>

<ol>
  <li>The object is <strong>read</strong> from the stream</li>
  <li>The JVM determines the object‚Äôs <strong>class type</strong></li>
  <li>The JVM attempts to <strong>find and load</strong> the object‚Äôs <strong>class</strong>. If the JVM can‚Äôt find and/or load the class,the JVM throws an exception and the deserialization fails</li>
  <li>A new object is given space on the heap,but the <strong>serialized object‚Äôs constructor does NOT run</strong>! Obviously,if the constructor ran,it would restore the state of the object back to its original ‚Äònew‚Äô state,and that‚Äôs not what we want. We want the object to be restored to the state it had when it was serialized,not when it was first created</li>
  <li>If the object has a non-serializable class somewhere up its inheritance tree,the <strong>constructor for that non-serializable class will run</strong> along with any constructors above that. Once the constructor chaining begins,you can‚Äôt stop it,which means all superclasses,begining with the first non-serializable one,will reinitialize their state</li>
  <li>The object‚Äôs <strong>instance variables are given the values from the serialized state</strong>. Transient variables are given a value of null for object reference and default for primitive</li>

<p>If you serialize an object,you must have the class in order to deserialize and use the object. OK,tha‚Äôs obvious. But what might be less obvious is what happens if you <strong><em>change the class</em></strong> in the meantime? Imagines trying to bring back a Dog object when one of its instance variables has changed from a double to a String. That violates Java‚Äôs type-safe sensibilities in a Big Way. But that‚Äôs not the only change that might hurt compatibility.</p>
